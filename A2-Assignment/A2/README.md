## Reflection

Please provide a reflection on your experience with this assignment-- what was interesting? what was hard? what do you feel like you learned?

Chiashi Yang - I found this assignment to be very interesting! I enjoyed getting to learn more about biology terms with a mix of programming. I thought the assignment was easier to manage compared to A1. I was confused about the purpose of the describeGeneration method, as it felt like I was supposed to be doing more when I just had to call the printGenInfo method. I learned more about using constructors and was able to refresh my memory on object oriented programming, especially since this assignment dealt with actual objects rather than generics.
