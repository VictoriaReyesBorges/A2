# A2 Genetic Algorithms

Your readme should include the following information. Each student needs to submit all of this information themselves, even when pair programming.

## Questions

Please briefly describe what you observed about the "winners" produced by your genetic algorithm. Did changing the parameter values have any effect on what you observed?

When the number of "winners"/'k' increases, the least fitness values were significantly lower than the values of the original parameters. 


## Reflection

Please provide a reflection on your experience with this assignment-- what was interesting? what was hard? what do you feel like you learned?

Shakila: The challenging part was making sure the offspring were built correctly in the evolve method. I had to carefully pick a random prefix from one parent and a random suffix from the other, combine them, and trim the result if it exceeded c_max. I also had to ensure that mutation was applied to each gene individually, not just once per offspring, by looping through the new chromosome and using the doesMutate method with the mutation rate m. And of course using ArrayList really helped here.

Chiashi Yang - I found this assignment to be very interesting! I enjoyed getting to learn more about biology terms with a mix of programming. I thought the assignment was easier to manage compared to A1. I was confused about the purpose of the describeGeneration method, as it felt like I was supposed to be doing more when I just had to call the printGenInfo method. I learned more about using constructors and was able to refresh my memory on object oriented programming, especially since this assignment dealt with actual objects rather than generics.

Kiara Sunil Singh - This assignment was hard, but wasnâ€™t as difficult as A1. This assignment helped me understand more about array lists and how to utilize them in real world simulations. I enjoyed working hands-on with a real world application. My group found connecting all the different methods and connecting the variables challenging. However, we were able to collaborate effectively and resolve any issues. 

Victoria Reyes Borges - I was able to understand this assignment better than the last! I found the genetic concept of it fun and also as if we were making a game. It was interesting working with more classmates this time around, I also found interesting making an constructor. It was hard understand what constructor 2 needed to use and connecting all the methods we worked on independently at the end. I learned how to use different logic concepts for my constructor that I will use for future assignments!
